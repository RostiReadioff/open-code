Dear friends of CMAS-open-code,
 
It has been a few weeks since we announced our project at the [CMAS meeting in Sheffield](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/blob/master/Communications/CMAS2019_Sheffield/CMAS-open-code.pdf), and here's an update on what we've been doing since then.
 
 
# Upcoming events

**[Mozilla Sprint for Internet Health event](http://www.mozillapulse.org/entry/1113), May 20th-24th**
These five days will be an excellent time to contribute to our project. Click [here](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/blob/master/README.md) to get started, share your ideas about the project with us, and get your questions answered by our team. At the end of the week, we will give a prize to the most active member of our community! 
 
**Coding workshop, September 2nd**
We will have a hands-on workshop at the RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital (SY10 7AG) to help you get started using the platform. The workshop is free to attend, but there is a limited number of places. Please complete [this application form](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/82C7MLX) by Friday May 31st, and we will let you know whether your application has been successful by Monday June 3rd. 
 
Please let us know if you have ideas for other in-person or online events to help more people get involved in the project!
 
 
# Newly added code

You can see a list of the code contributed by our community members [here](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/blob/master/Code/CodeIndex.md). Do you have code you could contribute, or a code wishlist? Get in touch!
- Neil Postans added code to calculate the [Gait Profile Score & Movement Analysis Profile](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/tree/master/Code/Gait_profile_score). To run it, you will need Python 2.7 and Vicon Nexus.
- Fabien Leboeuf added Excel code to calculate the [Standard Error of Measurement](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/tree/master/Code/Standard_Error_Measurement/Excel), and a link to the [Biomechanical Toolkit](https://github.com/cmasuki/open-code/tree/master/Code/c3d%20IO/Biomechanical%20toolkit%20(Btk)), which allows you to work with C3D files through C++, Matlab or Python 2.7.
- Sjoerd Brujin provided a link to Matlab code for reading [accelerometer data from a mobile phone in real time](https://github.com/SjoerdBruijn/StreamPhoneData), and Matlab code to calculate the [Local Dynamic Stability](https://github.com/SjoerdBruijn/LocalDynamicStability).


Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your contributions!
